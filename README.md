# Bad Vibe Coding
A collection of stories about when vibe coding goes bad.

Is it BAD vibe coding, bad VIBE coding, or bad vibe CODING?

> It's never -ve about the individual -- huge thanks and citations to everyone that share their story.

This isn't anti-vibe coding, it's more about **truthy vibe-coding over falsey vibe-coding**.

> Sometimes, to know what something is, you first have to know what it isn't.

The idea is to collect stories from good people who are honest about their -ve experiences when vibe coding. From these great people we can built a map of the minefields, rat traps, dead bodies and dead ends. Then, on this map, we might be able to draw a happy path for vibe coding.
