<h1>Contributing to Bad Vibe Coding</h1>
<p>Thank you for contributing to Bad Vibe Coding! This repo collects stories about when vibe coding goes wrong. Share your coding disasters, bugs, and lessons learned.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This is not anti-vibe coding: it's more about truthy vibe-coding over falsey vibe-coding.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Quick Overview</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Contributors</strong> Fork the repo, create a branch in your fork, add your story, push to your fork, and submit a PR to this repo.</li>
<li><strong>Story Format</strong> Use stories/story-date-user.md (e.g., story-20250720-viewyonder.md) with the provided template. Place images in images/ with names like story-date-user-1.png.</li>
<li><strong>Review</strong> Maintainers review your PR, may request changes, and merge it into the main repo.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Editorial</h2>
<p>This isn't an anti-vibe coding or flame wars scene. It's simple a constructive and objective counterbalance to all the blind positivity about vibe coding. Stories don't have to have opinions. If they do they should be constructure and balanced: thesis, antithesis, synthesis.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, to know what something is, you first need to know what it isn't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some simple editorial rules. PR submissions will be checked against these and rejected where they fall short.</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Citations and Links</em>: If you are submitting a bad vibe coding story from other sources (ie. it's not YOUR bad vibe coding story), then make sure to cite the original poster and link to the original post.</li>
<li><em>Image links over uploads</em>: Prefer links to original images over images copied and uploaded to the repo. Always add alt text to images.</li>
<li><em>Optional balanced opinion</em>: If you want to add an Opinion then add a section. If you do add an opinion, think and write like a journalist and at least offer a balanced perspective (thesis and antithesis). If you feel qualified, add a synthesis / 3rd way?</li>
<li><em>Human over AI</em>: Prefer human writing over AI writing. No problems with you using AI to help your writing, but if your submission smells like AI (ie. it's impenetrable or doesn't connect to Dear Reader) then it might be rejected.</li>
<li><em>Add meat to the bones</em>: Bonus points for adding more context to your story. For example, if the story begins on X, are there related sources in that story? Are there other pieces online that would help flesh things out?</li>
<li><em>Engage the OP</em>: Consider notifying the OP that you're submitting this to Bad Vibe Coding. Most OPs are open enough to share their experience and will not be upset. This isn't to flame or embarass them. It's actually about thanking them for sharing their experience to help everyone get better. It's kinda like a badge of honour!</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to create your story</h2>
<p>We use markdown for our stories. Each story is a standalone markdown file with its images in a central /images directory with all other images.</p>
<p>We use Github for collaboration which means you need to do two things to contribute:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork this repo to your own Github account and submit PRs.</li>
<li>Use a tool like VScode or one of the many Markdown editors.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1. Fork the repository</h3>
<p>Click the &quot;Fork&quot; button on the bad-vibe-coding GitHub page to create a copy under your GitHub account.</p>
<h3>2. Clone your fork</h3>
<p>Clone your fork to your local machine:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/bad-vibe-coding.git

<h2>Why We Use Forks, Branches, and Pull Requests</h2>
<p>For external contributors (those without write access), we use a forking workflow to keep the process secure and organized:</p>
<h3>Forking</h3>
<p>You work in a copy of the repo (your fork) under your GitHub account. This lets you make changes without affecting the main repo, as you don’t have direct write access.</p>
<h3>Branches</h3>
<p>Creating a branch (e.g., add-story-yourname) keeps your story separate from other changes. It prevents conflicts and makes it easier to manage multiple contributions.</p>
<h3>Pull Requests (PRs)</h3>
<p>A PR proposes your changes from your fork’s branch to the main repo’s main branch. Maintainers review your story for quality and fit. If changes are needed, you update your fork’s branch, and the PR reflects those updates. Once approved, your story is merged into the main repo.</p>
<p>This process ensures the main repo stays clean, contributions are reviewed, and everyone can contribute safely. Trusted contributors skip forking because they have write access to push branches directly to this repo.</p>
<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Be respectful and constructive. Offensive or inappropriate content will not be accepted.
Getting Collaborator Access
To become a trusted contributor with direct write access, submit a story via forking and contact the repo owner via [insert contact method, e.g., GitHub Issues or email]. Access is granted at the owner’s discretion.</p>
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Open an issue on the repo or reach out via [insert contact method]. For help with PRs, see GitHub’s guide.</p>
