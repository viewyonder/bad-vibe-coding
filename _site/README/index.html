<h1>Bad Vibe Coding</h1>
<p>A collection of stories about when vibe coding goes bad.</p>
<p>This isn't anti-vibe coding, it's more about truthy vibe-coding over falsey vibe-coding.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes, to know what something is, you first have to know what it isn't.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The idea is to collect stories from good people who are honest about their -ve experiences when vibe coding. From these great people we can built a map of the minefields, rat traps, dead bodies and dead ends. Then, on this map, we might be able to draw a happy path for vibe coding.</p>
